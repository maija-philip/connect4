    "Take this moment to gaze into the infinite void of the game board and ponder: is it the board watching you?",
    "Not your turn yet, but don't worry—this waiting period is a gift from the universe. Probably.",
    "Patience, young strategist. The spirits of the board are aligning for your next move.",
    "While you wait, consider writing a haiku about the tension of this moment. Here, I'll start: 'Discs suspended, wait / Gravity shall choose the fate / Soon, the grid decides.'",
    "This waiting time is brought to you by Connect 4 Procrastination Services™. Please enjoy your delay.",
    "Take this opportunity to mentally rehearse your victory speech. It's going to be epic.",

    "Not your turn? Perfect! Use this time to ponder why they call it Connect 4 and not Drop-a-Disc Drama.",
    "Your move isn't ready yet. Why not imagine what this game would look like in zero gravity?",
    "Take this opportunity to name each column on the board. Bonus points for rhyming.",
    "While you're waiting, a Connect 4 tournament could've started and finished. Just saying.",
    "Hold on—did you know the pieces are actually sentient and judging your gameplay? No pressure.",
    "They say patience is a virtue, but in this game, it's also a spectator sport.",
    "Your turn isn't here yet. Use this time to telepathically intimidate your opponent.",
